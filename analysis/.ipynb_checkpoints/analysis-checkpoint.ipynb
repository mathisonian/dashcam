       " 'PNC recently informed me that they made a \" business decision \\'\\' to close my accounts. I have numerous concerns related to the accounts which are slated for closure, with that said : PNC has determined to close my performance spend and virtual wallet spend accounts through no fault of my own, I am left with serious concerns in that the {$300.00} promotional offer which was offered to me in exchange for opening said accounts and meeting certain conditions will not be honored and I believe that PNC has elected to close my accounts with the specific intention to avoid paying out on the advertised promotional offer. I will add that the subject {$300.00} promotional offer extended to me had several conditions which were required for the account holder to qualify for the promotional payment including : 1. The checking account must be opened at the branch using the appropriate flyer ( attached ) between XX/XX/2015-XX/XX/2015 to qualify for the {$100.00}, {$200.00}, {$300.00} reward. A qualifying direct deposit must be received and 1 payment must be completed via PNC online bill pay within 60 days of account opening. \\n2.The total amount of all qualifying direct deposits credited to your performance select or the spend account of your virtual wallet with performance select must be at least {$5000.00} to active the {$300.00} promotional payment I fulfilled all of the required obligations outlined above to meet the conditional requirements outlined by PNC under the terms and conditions to qualify for the {$300.00} promotional offer, curiously however PNC only credited my account with {$75.00} which is an amount below even the lowest promotional offer specified on the {$100.00}, {$200.00}, {$300.00} promotion. Upon which time I notified PNC of their error with respect to the promotional payment it was suggested I open an internal dispute which PNC quickly dismissed. After I reopened the internal dispute to collect the remaining {$220.00} in promotional offers which are rightfully owed to me, PNC then informed me that my account was downgraded and in the process of being closed which appears to be an action taken as direct retaliation for my instance that PNC honor the promotional agreement. Denial of full payment on the promotional offer is ill advised, unethical, fraudulent and entirely unacceptable behavior which will not be tolerated. \\n\\nPNC \\'s actions with respect to the aforementioned account closures & denial of promotional payment constitute fraud in the inducement, fraud in the factum, bait and switch and failure of specific performance related to the terms and conditions of the promotional offer which all parties expressly agreed to be bound by and was the basis for the bargain at the time of account opening. \\n\\nTo allow me to complete all of my responsibilities with respect to the promotional offer and then arbitrarily determine to close the accounts to avoid payment is a procedural and substantive unconscionability on PNC \\'s part. Under common law an offer can not be revoked after it has been accepted. Furthermore in this instance performance remains and consideration exists so PNC has a duty and obligation to pay the full amount of the promotional offer. Moreover PNC \\'s failure to pay the full promotional offer for which I had fully qualified for and PNC \\'s refusal to state a valid reason for account closure constitutes bad faith as it would appear that the account was closed solely with the intention of depriving the account holder of the promotional payment. \\n\\nIt is undisputed that a valid contract exists and PNC has a good faith obligation to honor the contract and to provide payment in full on the promotional offer. \\n',\n",

However, we were rejected several months ago because the person assessing our property erroneously claimed that we were n't the home owners, even though we successfully re-financed the first time without difficulty using the same information. Instead of checking to make sure, BOA took the word of the property assessor and outright rejected us. After a month of complaining to BOA managers, they agreed to re-open our file and start the re-financing process over again. Then, just three weeks ago, we received another rejection letter stating that they could not verify employment, even though we had already provided them with the contact information of our company 's human resource, receptionist, and supervisor. Again, as we have stated before, we had not changed our work company since our first successful refinance. If BOA was able to verify our employment the first time, why were they not able to verify this time if none of the information has changed? We have since re-sent them the contact information of our employers about two weeks ago, but still no word. We are very frustrated over this drawn-out process and believe this is very irresponsible of BOA for doing shoddy work. We believe we are being discriminated against because we are borrowing under {$150000.00} and BOA does not want to process a loan that is so little, which is why they keep finding baseless excuses to reject us.

Most of the additional money was applied to my principle of my loan, or the money was put in a side account, and nothing was done with it to reduce my shortfall in my impounds account. When I tried to notify Shellpoint about an impending increase in my impounds account, they told me to write a different check for the amount of my shortage for my impounds account, and write Escrow Only on the check a long with my account number. I did everything they ask, and my checks were still applied to my principle. I called them again to speak with someone in escrow regarding my impending increase in my escrow account. They stated all information must go through customer service, and I could not speak with their escrow department. They said I could fax a letter to them about my problem.

       " 'I was required to pay {$25.00} interest each month on my student loan. I missed a payment so was in arrears by {$25.00}. So i logged into the Sallie Mae website and set up an auto debit of {$50.00} per month so that I would clear my arrears and start paying down my loan by more than my minimum. When the auto debit came around instead of taking {$50.00} out of my bank it just took {$25.00} leaving me in arrears. I then got phone calls and messages from Sallie Mae telling me I was in arrears. When I checked the auto debit was still set up for {$50.00} per month but despite that Sallie Mae only took the minimum {$25.00} out. When I phoned up to ask why they told me that that is the way the system works and that I could not set up an auto debit for more than the required minimum. This is despite the fact that there online system allowed me to do this, still reports that I have a {$50.00} per month auto debit and above all else should allow me to pay down my loan faster than the minimum. When I challenged them again they told me that the only way to pay down the loan faster was by one off single payments. \\nMy frustration was that at no time was I told that I could only pay off the minimum amount of {$25.00} through the auto debit system, and that by not taking out my {$50.00} payment it kept me in arrears unintentionally on my part. \\nI should be able to pay down my loans faster if I want though the auto payment system and if this is not possible Sallie Mae should have notified me when I set up the auto debit and not then complain when the arrears payment was not taken out by them. \\nFor students learning about how to handle financial management the system in place seems to only help Sallie Mae not the student. In helping to keep the student in arrears even when they tried to pay off the loan faster than required. \\nEven there new look website is poorly designed mixing interest with payments in the same column so its harder to see how the loan balance is going up or down based upon the loan servicing. Why oh Why does the loan statement not separate additional charges and interest into its own column separate from the payments made to pay down the loan. This would give students a much clearer idea of how there loan is progressing rather than having to read down and across for each number to understand its meaning. Once again a missed opportunity to make it easier for students to service there loan. \\n',\n",
